  "description": "## Background The 2020 Election, which is one of 2020's major events in American history presents a chance for American's voices to be heard. But even before people vote, a lot of people have made up their minds on how they would vote in the election. One way voters express their opinions is through contributing money to the presidential candidates. Donations are made to committees registered by the Federal Election Commision (FEC). Each of these committees then, in turn uses the money in some way or another to support a candidate or oppose a candidate. <br/><br/> In the 2020 Election cycle, as in previous elections, the FEC discloses donations made to the candidates. This project aimed at looking into individual donations made to the presidential candidates from [FEC Bulk Data download](https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data). The FEC defines individual donations as donations made by individuals to political committees and are included in the itemized list if the contribution’s election cycle-to-date amount is over $200 for contributions to candidate committees or the contribution’s calendar year-to-date amount is over $200 for contributions to political action committees (PACs) and party committees<sup>1</sup>.  <br/><br/> The data in this research examines the itemized individual contributions made to the candidate committees: [Trumps candidate committee](https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P80001571/): DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC. (FEC Committee ID: C00580100) as well as [Joe Biden's candidate committee](https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P80000722/): BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT (FEC Committee ID: C00703975).",
